## 1. System State Update
We have just completed a **Critical Infrastructure Refactor**.
The project was paused to standardize the Documentation Grid and harden the Agentic Safety Protocols.

### What Changed?
1.  **SOP Upgrade (Priority 0):**
    *   **New Section 14 (The Discussion Lock):** Forbids write-actions during consultation.
    *   **New Section 15 (The Assessment Rule):** Mandates "Answer First" before Action.
    *   **New Section 16 (The Conversational Anchor):** Mandates injecting `[ ] DISCUSSION` tasks into `task.md` to prevent Goal Persistence bugs.
2.  **Documentation Standard:**
    *   Adopted "Standard Metadata Table" for all Markdown files.
    *   Refactored 20+ files (Strategies, Logs, Test Reports, Video Prompts).
    *   Verified 100% compliance.

## 2. Immediate Instructions for Next Agent

### A. Protocol Ingestion (Mandatory)
Before you write a single line of code or plan Phase 3b:
1.  **READ** `SOP/__summary_development_workflow.md` (specifically lines 200+).
2.  **ACKNOWLEDGE** Section 16 (The Conversational Anchor). You must prove you understand that *discussion* blocks *execution*.

### B. Resume Phase 3b
Once you are aligned with the new SOPs:
1.  Open `task.md`.
2.  Locate "Phase 3b (Apples-to-Apples Experiment)".
3.  Resume the objective: **Train Model A_Native (Uncensored)**.
    *   *Note:* The environment and documentation are now clean. You have a solid foundation.

## 3. Context Load
*   **SOP:** `SOP/__summary_development_workflow.md` (The New Constitution)
*   **Strategy:** `docs/documentation_strategy.md` (The New Grid)
*   **Task List:** `task.md` (Current State)

*System Message: The Infrastructure is clean. The Safety Latches are installed. You are clear to proceed.*
