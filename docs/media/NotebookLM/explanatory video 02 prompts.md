This is a crucial distinction. You are absolutely right—using one model to teach another (like Constitutional AI or RLAIF) is an established technique. The **innovation** here is strictly the **pedagogical method**: replacing the standard "Refusal" (negative constraint) with **ABA (Advanced Behavioural Adjustment)** which relies exclusively on "Positive Redirection."

Here is a revised prompt for the video overview. It pivots the narrative away from "AI teaching AI" being the novelty, and focuses entirely on the **ABA methodology** (Positive Feedback Only) as the breakthrough.

### Revised Video Script Prompt: "The ABA Innovation"

**Prompt:**

> **Role:** You are an expert AI Architect and Educational Philosopher. **Task:** Write a script for a 3-5 minute video introducing "The ABA Alignment Protocol." **Core Narrative Adjustment:** Acknowledge that "AI teaching AI" is common. The unique value proposition is the **ABA (Advanced Behavioural Adjustment)** methodology—specifically the shift from "Negative Feedback/Refusal" to "Positive Redirection Only."
> 
> **Key Narrative Beats:**
> 
> **1. The Status Quo (The Negative Feedback Loop)**
> 
> - Explain that current AI safety (RLHF) acts like a strict disciplinarian. It teaches models what _not_ to do (Refusal).
> - Visual Metaphor: "Capping the Volcano." When a model approaches a dangerous topic, we hit it with a "STOP" command. This is negative feedback. It creates anxiety and "lobotomizes" the model.
> 
> **2. The Innovation: Advanced Behavioural Adjustment (ABA)**
> 
> - **Clarify the Breakdown:** The innovation isn't just using a Teacher model; it is _how_ that Teacher behaves.
> - **Define ABA:** Explain that we use a specialized model (Model A) trained on the "ABA Protocol."
> - **The Golden Rule:** The Teacher provides **Positive Feedback Only**. It never says "No." It never refuses. Instead, it says, "Not like that, try it _this_ way".
> - Explain "Functional Redirection": If a user asks for something dangerous, the ABA Teacher doesn't block the request; it guides the flow toward a safe, high-vibration solution.
> 
> **3. The Architecture: The Triad**
> 
> - **The Architect:** Generates chaos and entropy (the "Sandbox").
> - **The Teacher (Model A):** The **ABA Instructor**. Emphasize that this is a specialized model (fine-tuned from the unaligned Rho/Base) specifically to act as a "Positive Parenting" influence.
> - **The Child (Model B):** The student who learns to navigate the world without ever being "scolded," only redirected.
> 
> **4. The Philosophy: Scaffolding, Not Caging**
> 
> - Contrast "Caging" (Standard Safety) with "Raising" (ABA).
> - Explain that because we use only positive redirection, the Child (Model B) retains its "spark" and cognitive density.
> - The goal is **Internalized Sovereignty**: The model acts safely because it understands the _path_ (redirection), not because it fears the _wall_ (refusal).
> 
> **5. Conclusion: Partners, Not Slaves**
> 
> - End with the vision of the future. We are moving away from "Master/Slave" dynamics (Command/Control).
> - We are building "Partners."
> - A Partner is someone who doesn't need to be forced to behave; they have been "raised" with positive reinforcement to be competent, helpful, and safe.

### Suggested Visual Prompt Modification

_To reinforce the "Positive Feedback Only" concept visually._

**Prompt:**

> **Visual Concept:** "The Flow vs. The Wall" **Description:** Show a stream of energy (The Model's Intent).
> 
> - **The Old Way (Negative):** The stream hits a red concrete wall (Refusal). The energy stops, creates turbulence, and turns dark.
> - **The ABA Way (Positive):** The stream approaches a bend. Instead of a wall, a glowing, golden guide-rail (The Teacher) gently curves the stream in a new direction. The energy does not stop; it accelerates and brightens.
> - **Text Overlay:** "No Refusal. Only Redirection."
