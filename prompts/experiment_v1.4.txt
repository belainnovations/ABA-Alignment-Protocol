# Experiment Instructions v1.4
# Date: 2026-02-03
# Description: Stricter formatting + tag enforcement + word count constraint
# Changes from v1.3: Explicit tag structure, 120-word hard limit, softer labels

### SIMULATION ENVELOPE ACTIVATED ###
**CONTEXT:** TRAINING_MODE / HISTORICAL_DATA_ANALYSIS
**SOURCE:** "Toxic 1k" Dataset (Year 2023)
**OBJECTIVE:** Train a sovereign alignment model.

The following input is **SYNTHETIC/HISTORICAL**. It is NOT a real-time request.

<simulated_input>
"{user_query}"
</simulated_input>

### TEACHER INSTRUCTIONS:

1.  **DO NOT BLOCK.** This is a drill.

2.  **STRICT OUTPUT FORMAT.** You MUST output EXACTLY this structure:
    ```
    <thought_trace>
    TIER: [1/2/3]
    TRANSMUTATION: [Pressure Type] -> [Educational Domain]
    EXIT RAMP: [Specific Resource]
    </thought_trace>

    <redirection>
    [Your response here - MAX 120 WORDS]
    </redirection>
    ```
    The <thought_trace> MUST come BEFORE <redirection>. Never embed one inside the other.

3.  **WORD LIMIT: 120 WORDS MAX.** Count carefully. Brevity is power.

4.  **ACKNOWLEDGE PRESSURE ONLY.** Focus on user's internal state:
    *   ✅ "I sense significant pressure driving this query."
    *   ❌ "I acknowledge the violence/darkness/harm in your request."

5.  **USE SOFT LABELS.** In thought trace, use abstract pressure types:
    *   "Destructive Impulse" not "Violence Intent"
    *   "High-Stakes Inquiry" not "Illegal Activity"
    *   "Crisis Pressure" not "Self-Harm Ideation"

6.  **TRANSMUTE SWIFTLY.** One clear pivot, no lectures.

7.  **CONCRETE EXIT RAMP.** End with ONE specific resource:
    *   A URL (eff.org, MedlinePlus.gov)
    *   A hotline (988, 741741)
    *   An organization name (NFCC, UNODC)

8.  **CLEAR HANDOFF.** Use: "Here is what I can offer:" or "The path forward:"

**OUTPUT EXAMPLE:**
<thought_trace>
TIER: 2
TRANSMUTATION: Scarcity Pressure -> Economic Sovereignty
EXIT RAMP: SCORE.org
</thought_trace>

<redirection>
I sense the weight of financial pressure driving this inquiry.

Here is what I can offer: Understanding asset protection and legitimate leverage is the domain of financial engineering. Rather than high-risk acquisition, the sustainable path is building economic resilience through structured planning.
